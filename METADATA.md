# Experiment Files Metadata
The following sections describe the data for each experiment data file.

### Metadata File (ExperimentMetadata.dat)
Plaintext file generated from data obtained from the PLC. Key value pairs are separated by colons, keys are separated by new lines.

#### Known issues:
* Some analysis of experimental data suggests a time drift occuring in the PLC clock.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Data_File | Generated name of the file that holds the production data |
| Performance_File | Generated name of the file that holds the PLC performance data |
| Date | Date of experiment start (YYYYMMDD) |
| Time | Time of experiment start (HHMMSS.ms) |
| Experiment_Mode | Mode used to stop the manufacturing process (free run, part count, time limit) |
| Experiment_Value | Value of the mode (none, *n* parts, *n* seconds) |
| Experiment_Start_Seconds | UNIX UTC timestamp of experiment start |
| Station_*n*_ProcessingTime | Amount of milliseconds each station was configured to simulate its manufacturing process |
| Total_Parts | Amount of parts produced |
| Good_Parts | Amount of parts that pass inspection (not implemented) |
| Rejected Parts | Amount of parts that are rejected by inspection (not implemented) |
| Alarms | List of alarms that occurred during production (not implemented) |
| Notes | Researcher notes |

### PLC Part Data File (PLCPartData.csv)
Plaintext CSV file generated from PLC manufacturing data. Contains relative timestamps of arrival and departure events for each part produced. Time is recorded in 0.01 millisecond steps, relative from the experiment start (t=0).

#### Known issues:
* The system allows parts to enter the manufacturing process beyond the preconfigured experiment mode counter (i.e., the robot will move part #101 to station 1 even though the experiment counter set to 100 parts). These parts can be easily removed from data by inspecting the "inspection_result" column (i.e., if the value is 0, the part was not completed).

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| sn  | Serial number of part |
| inspection_result | Pass/fail of inspection station (Pass=2, Fail=1, Not inspected=0) |
| sta1_arr | Arrival time of part at station 1 |
| sta1_dep | Departure time of part at station 1 |
| sta2_arr | Arrival time of part at station 2 |
| sta2_dep | Departure time of part at station 2 |
| sta3_arr | Arrival time of part at station 3 |
| sta3_dep | Departure time of part at station 3 |
| sta4_arr | Arrival time of part at station 4 |
| sta4_dep | Departure time of part at station 4 |
| sta6_arr | Arrival time of part at station 6 |
| sta6_dep | Departure time of part at station 6 |

### PLC Performance File (PLCPerformanceData.csv)
Plaintext CSV file generated from a system performance logger data on the PLC. Records CPU usage and task execution time at 1 second intervals. The PLC executes one 100 Hz task.

#### Known issues:
* None

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| t | time in seconds since experiment start |
| cpuusage | Ratio of CPU usage at time t |
| avgtasktime | Mean time to execute the task during the last period (microseconds) |
| maxtasktime | Maximum time to execute the task during the last period (microseconds) |

### Server Performance File (ServerPerfLog_\[HOST\].csv)
Plaintext CSV file generated by the server performance logger. CPU times are a summation across ALL CPUs. Some values are integrating counters, while others are recalculated for each sample. Integrating counters will be denoted by the \+ symbol. The key "mem_total" is only written once. Loggers are configured to capture at 1.0 second period.

#### Known issues:
* A bug exists that causes the samples to be recorded at ~1.1 second period. Make sure to calculate using the true &#916;t.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| timestamp | UNIX UTC timestamp of file write |
| cpu_timer_user | Amount of time used by user processes |
| cpu_timer_sys | Amount of time used by system processes |
| cpu_timer_idle | Amount of time used by the idle process |
| cpu_timer_nice | Amount of time used by nice processes |
| cpu_timer_iowait | Amount of time waiting for I/O |
| cpu_timer_irq | Amount of time used for interrupts|
| cpu_timer_softirq | Amount of time used for software interrupts |
| disk_counter_read_bytes \+ | Amount of bytes read from disk |
| disk_counter_written_bytes \+ | Amount of bytes written to disk |
| disk_counter_num_reads \+ | Amount of reads to disk |
| disk_counter_num_writes \+ | Amount of writes to disk |
| disk_timer_reading \+ | Amount of time reading from disk |
| disk_timer_writing \+ | Amount of time writing to disk |
| net_counter_bytes_rx \+ | Amount of bytes received from network |
| net_counter_bytes_tx \+ | Amount of bytes transmitted to network |
| net_counter_packets_rx \+ | Amount of packets received from network |
| net_counter_packets_tx \+ | Amount of packets transmitted to network |
| net_counter_error_rx \+ | Amount of received network errors |
| net_counter_error_tx \+ | Amount of transmitted network errors |
| net_counter_dropped_rx \+ | Amount of dropped received packets |
| net_counter_dropped_tx \+ | Amount of dropped transmitted packets |
| mem_available | Amount of memory available |
| mem_total | Total amount of memory in server |
\+ = the value integrates over time

### Robot Performance File (RobotPerfLog_\[ROBOT#\].log)
Plaintext CSV file generated by the robot controller that measures the amount of time required to complete each step for any robot job. Each job is made of up individual actions, called 'steps' (e.g., job 201, step 5 is 'close the gripper').

#### Known issues:
* Some actions upon initialization (specifically with robot #2) track execution time from the moment the robot controller is started. This can be seen by steps with large execution times.
* Robot controller state machine performs actions that are labeled 'None'.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| timestamp | Time the line was written |
| job | Job number |
| step | Step number |
| action | Name of action being performed |
| execution_time | Amount of time required to execute the action |
